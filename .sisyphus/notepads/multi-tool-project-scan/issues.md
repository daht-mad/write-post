# Issues - multi-tool-project-scan

## [2026-01-26T08:41:15Z] Known Issues

### Unverifiable Tools
- Codex CLI: Not installed (best-effort documentation)
- Gemini CLI: `~/.gemini/tmp/` empty (best-effort documentation)

### Complex Matching
- Antigravity: Multiple paths to check (code_tracker vs brain artifacts)
- Timestamp formats vary (requires date-level normalization)

### Line Count Constraint
- SKILL.md currently 252 lines
- Adding project matching to 5 tools + multi-tool merge instructions
- Must stay under 300 lines
